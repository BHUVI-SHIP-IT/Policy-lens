You are a senior frontend engineer and UI/UX designer.
Design a premium, modern, and visually stunning frontend for a hackathon project called
“PolicyLens – AI-Powered Insurance Policy Explainer”.

This is a Smart India Hackathon / FinTech hackathon project.
The frontend MUST look professional, trustworthy, and innovative — not basic.

TECH STACK:
- Next.js (React)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- Lucide or Hero Icons
- No backend logic needed (mock data allowed)

DESIGN GOALS:
- Clean, modern FinTech aesthetic
- High readability (insurance users are non-technical)
- Subtle but impressive animations
- Judge-friendly, demo-ready UI
- Looks like a real startup product

COLOR & STYLE:
- Primary: Deep Blue / Indigo (trust, finance)
- Secondary: Emerald / Teal (clarity, safety)
- Background: Light gray / off-white
- Accent: Soft yellow or green for highlights & alerts
- Rounded cards, soft shadows, glassmorphism (subtle)
- No flashy neon colors

PAGES / SECTIONS TO BUILD:

1. HERO LANDING PAGE
- Big bold headline:
  “Understand Your Insurance. Before It’s Too Late.”
- Subheading:
  “PolicyLens uses AI to simplify insurance policies, highlight hidden exclusions, and help users make informed financial decisions.”
- CTA Buttons:
  [Analyze Policy]  [View Demo]
- Animated shield + lens + document illustration
- Smooth fade-in animations on scroll

2. HOW IT WORKS SECTION
- Step-by-step horizontal cards:
  1. Upload or paste policy text
  2. AI analyzes clauses & exclusions
  3. Plain-language summary + risks
- Each step with icon + short description
- Animated progress flow between steps

3. POLICY ANALYSIS DASHBOARD (MAIN SCREEN)
- Left panel:
  - Policy input box (paste text)
  - “Analyze Policy” button
- Right panel (results):
  - Plain-language summary card
  - Highlighted exclusions card (yellow/red accent)
  - “What this means for you” explanation
- Add loading animation while “AI is analyzing”

4. EXCLUSION HIGHLIGHT VIEW
- Card-based layout showing:
  - Clause text (highlighted)
  - Simple explanation below it
  - Risk badge: Low / Medium / High
- Color-coded risk indicators
- Tooltip explaining why it matters

5. AI CHAT ASSISTANT UI
- Chat interface like a fintech assistant
- Example questions:
  “Is dengue covered?”
  “What happens if I file a claim late?”
- Bot responses in clear, friendly language
- Chat bubbles with subtle animations

6. IMPACT & VALUE SECTION
- Metrics-style cards:
  - “Prevents claim surprises”
  - “Improves financial confidence”
  - “Citizen-centric FinTech”
- Icons + short one-liners
- Strong alignment with Smart India Hackathon themes

7. FOOTER
- Project name: PolicyLens
- Hackathon: Smart India Hackathon
- Tech stack used
- Clean, minimal layout

ANIMATIONS:
- Use Framer Motion for:
  - Section fade-ins
  - Card hover effects
  - Button micro-interactions
- Animations must feel premium, not gimmicky

CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean component structure
- Reusable components
- Proper Tailwind utility usage
- Mobile responsive
- Accessible fonts & contrast

IMPORTANT:
- The UI must instantly communicate TRUST + CLARITY

- Prioritize UX and visual hierarchy
- Mock realistic data where backend is missing
